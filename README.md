## How to play

Playing is very simple - you turn over one card and then try to find a matching card.
When you click on the first card of a turn and have exposed a corresponding card in a previous turn, a fun animation tells you that the pair is known(matched).To win you will have to find all the matching cards.

## Start Rating

The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects your performance. At the beginning of a game, you'll have 3 stars. After a certain numbers of  moves, it will decrease the start rating.
