## How to play

Playing is very simple - you turn over one card and then try to find a matching card.
When you click on the first card of a turn and have exposed a corresponding card in a previous turn, a fun animation tells you that the pair is known(matched).To win you will have to find all the matching cards.

## Score

Whenever you make a successfully match 2 times your rating will increase one start.
The same goes when you fail matching, your rating will decrease one start.
